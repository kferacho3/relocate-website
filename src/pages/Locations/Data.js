    description: 'Our primary market will be located in Atlanta, Georgia along with surrounding counties. As we expand, we hope to be able to cover all of Georgia and its neigboring states. Atlanta is one of the best cities to start a moving and logistics company as we believe that Georgia is a growing city for outsiders moving in to the south. This is especially due to the recent surge in pricing within the realestate market. We plan to take advantage of this by offering our service to make these moves affordable and possible. The Georgia atmosphere also has a large density of experienced workers for the business which will help us accomodate all clients by delivering a humanitarian based service from our associates. ',

    description: 'Chicago, Illinois is another great city to start with as it is not only the our founderâ€™s home city, but also another city effected by the recent housing market pricing. There will be a surplus of individuals relocating into these areas to which we will supply them with teams of movers to help them make these moves possible. Chicago inhabits many individuals in the same work force too so introducing a formal and legit moving company would make it easy to transition workers into our platform.',
